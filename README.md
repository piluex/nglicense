# nglicense
ng license is an "ad-hoc" license to any license to make your code illegal to post on github.

I invented this license because I noticed github is making a lot of moves to make you upload your code (or others code) to github. Today (2020/04/14) github announced they will even allow you to upload in private repositories for free!!! 

Isn't that strange? There is clearly a value for github in storing your code.

Well, "they say" the will sell you tools as a service (which is already bad... get used to a tool that you cannot own...).

I say that in addition to that, if you don't use or buy that they get a lot of value; Imagine having the best tools, funded by idiots, and all the code. They even have a query language for code (ex seemle ql). They can create queries looking for specific code behaviours... They can find and enforce software patents. They can find vulnerabilities. They can generate binaries from existing vulnerable code pieces and find binaries that match this signatures. The list of bad things one can do with all this code and the tools is VERY VERY long. 


No one should have this kind of power. Specially not Microsoft. I for once prefeer to use free tools and avoid sharing my code with Microsoft, to give some balance, to stop this before it becomes bad. You are free to choose... for now.
