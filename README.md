# nglicense
ng license is an "ad-hoc" license to any license to make your code illegal to post on github.

This license was invented because github is making a lot of moves to make us upload our code (or others code) to github. Today (2020/04/14) github announced they will even allow you to upload in private repositories for free!!! 

Isn't that strange? There is clearly a value for github in storing our code.

Well, "they say" the will sell you tools as a service (which is already bad... get used to a tool that you cannot own...).

In addition to that, if we don't use or buy the services they get a lot of value; Remember, information is power. Imagine having the best tools, funded by idiots, and all the code. They even have a query language for code (ex seemle ql). They can create queries looking for specific code behaviours... They can find and enforce software patents. They can find vulnerabilities. They can generate binaries from existing vulnerable code pieces and find binaries that match this signatures. The list of bad things one can do with all this code and the tools is VERY VERY long. (If someone ever wanted to train machine learning to do fun code-related stuff and one already owns a tool that generates a "generic" semantic representation of a lot of languages)


No one should have this kind of power. Specially not Microsoft. I for once prefeer to use free tools and avoid sharing my code with Microsoft, to give some balance, to stop this before it becomes bad. You are free to choose... for now.

One thing is for them to have our e-mails, photos, location, conversations... That's already a lot of power. Why give them our code, our code is our toughts, our work. We should not surrender.

# the license...

I'm no lawyer, but I think it's good enough to add a "ng" to the license you choose and then write something like this:

"NG meanse no github. This code should not be uploaded to github, if you find this code on github please inform the author."

If a lawyer or legal expert reads this, please make it better.
